Build Process for Raspberry Pi Pico (Windows, Minimal Command Line)

1. Finish Editing Script:
   - Edit `main.c` in `C:\pico\my_projects` (e.g., in VS Code or any text editor).
   - Ensure `CMakeLists.txt` is updated if new libraries are needed (e.g., `hardware_gpio`).

2. Build the Project: (Ctrl + s to savea and build)
   - Open PowerShell (or Command Prompt) and navigate to project folder:
     cd C:\pico\my_projects
   - Configure CMake (only needed if `CMakeLists.txt` changes):
     cmake -S . -B build -G "MinGW Makefiles"
   - Build the project:
     cmake --build build
   - Output: `my_project.uf2` appears in `C:\pico\my_projects\build`.

3. Flash to Pico (One-Line Command):
   - Put Pico in BOOTSEL mode:
     - Disconnect USB, hold BOOTSEL button, plug in USB, release BOOTSEL.
     - Pico appears as "RPI-RP2" drive (e.g., D:).
   - Run in PowerShell (replace D: with your drive letter):
     Copy-Item -Path C:\pico\my_projects\build\my_project.uf2 -Destination D:
   - Pico restarts and runs the new code.

   Copy-Item -Path C:\pico\my_projects\build/my_project.uf2 -Destination  D:

4. Verify:
   - Open PuTTY (Serial, COM port from Device Manager, 115200 baud).
   - Check for expected output (e.g., "Hello from Pico!").

Notes:
- Ensure ARM GCC (e.g., 14.2.1), CMake, and Pico SDK are in PATH or configured in VS Code.
- If build fails, check PowerShell output for errors.
